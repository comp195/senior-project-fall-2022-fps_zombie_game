Special note:
So far we have already created start menu and end menu scene. We also create two awesome terrian for the project.
We have not yet start the main part of the game; such as, zombie Controller, weapons Controller, etc
During the past week, we have faced a lot of git issue. We got errors from pulling and pushing. A lot of progress got delayed because of this.
We created a new github repo for this project to pervent all the old error from the previous repo.
(Oct. 16, 2022 Update)
We each worked on a part of the project. This week, we have a working zombie, a score board, and guns with shooting functions. 
However, this weekend, when we tried to push our works, there are more problem with the GitHub. Now we can't push some of 
our progress to the repo.
